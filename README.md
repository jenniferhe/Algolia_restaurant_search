# Restaurant Real Time Search with Algolia

Algolia's hosted search API helps product builders create lightning-fast, highly relevant search to connect their users with what matters. This project exploits algolia's service to build a demo for a large restaurant reservation website in order to highlight the great search experience. 

- Produce the HTML markup and CSS needed to reproduce the UI provided by the client. To do so, you can write vanilla CSS or with a processor of your choice.

- Using the [Algolia JS Helper](https://community.algolia.com/algoliasearch-helper-js/)  to implement an as-you-type search experience that enables users to easily find restaurants: both by passing a search query and/or filtering on the “type of cuisine”

- Leverage the user’s location to show restaurants closer to them higher in the results—with a fallback if they dont’t allow for geolocation permissions in the browser
